        I transitioned from agricultural research into software development through
        hands-on projects and bootcamps. I enjoy turning ideas into intuitive, reliable
        products and collaborating in high-performing teams. My toolbox includes
        JavaScript/TypeScript, React, Node.js/Express, PostgreSQL, Python and C.
